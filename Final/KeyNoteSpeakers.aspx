                        I&#39;m Richard Stallman, founder of the Free Software Movement. I campaign for computer users&#39; freedom -- for instance, your freedom to control the software you use, to redistribute the software to others. Software that respects the user&#39;s freedom is what we call <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html" title="The Free Software definition.">free software</a>.</p>
                    <p>
                        In 1983 I announced the plan to develop a complete free operating system called GNU. The system that millions of people use, and often refer to as &quot;Linux&quot;, is a variant of <a href="http://www.gnu.org/gnu/the-gnu-project.html" title="Info about the GNU Project.">the GNU system</a>.</p>

                    <p>James Gosling received a BSc in Computer Science from the University of Calgary, Canada in 1977. 
                        He received a PhD in Computer Science from Carnegie-Mellon University in 1983. The title of his thesis was 
                        "The Algebraic Manipulation of Constraints". He spent many years as a VP & Fellow at Sun Microsystems. 
                        He has built satellite data acquisition systems, a multiprocessor version of Unix, several compilers, mail 
                        systems and window managers. He has also built a WYSIWYG text editor, a constraint based drawing editor and 
                        a text editor called `Emacs' for Unix systems. At Sun his early activity was as lead engineer of the NeWS window
                         system. He did the original design of the Java programming language and implemented its original compiler and 
                        virtual machine. He has been a contributor to the Real-Time Specification for Java, and a researcher at Sun labs where 
                        his primary interest was software development tools. He then was the Chief Technology Officer of Sun's Developer Products 
                        Group and the CTO of Sun's Client Software Group. He briefly worked for Oracle after the acquisition of Sun. After a year off
                        , he spent some time at Google and is now the chief software architect at Liquid Robotics where he spends his time writing
                         software for the Waveglider, an autonomous ocean-going robot. </p>

                    <p>Tim Berners-Lee was the man leading the development of the World Wide Web (with help of course), the defining of HTML
                         (hypertext markup language) used to create web pages, HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) and URLs (Universal Resource Locators)
                        . All of those developments took place between 1989 and 1991. Tim Berners-Lee is considered the primary author of HTML,
                         assisted by his colleagues at CERN, an international scientific organization based in Geneva, Switzerland.</p>
